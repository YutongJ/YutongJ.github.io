Greetings! 

<!-- I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division.html), where I will be working with Dr. [Aaron Hudson](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/hudson-aaron.html) and Dr. [Peter Gilbert](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/gilbert-peter.html). Prior to joining Fred Hutch, I completed my PhD in [the Biostatistics at Emory University](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html), under the guidance of Dr. [David Benkeser](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=8917). I obtained my Bachelor degree in medicine (M.D. equivalency in the US) from Fudan University .

I am quite interested in solving the health-related problems, thus I seek to fill the gap between the medicine and statistics and further help improve the living quality of everyone. This led me to the biostatistics area, which can best mount my enthusiasm.

My recent research focuses on causal inference and machine learning, particularly in the development of statistical procedures for efficient estimation and robust inference with flexible ML tools. Broadly, I am interested in methodological researches on high-dimensional feature identification, targeted minimum loss-based estimation, and theory for two-stage sampling designs, which are usually rooted in vaccine clinical trials.

<!-- If you are also interested in the above areas, please contact me at [yutong.jin@emory.edu](yutong.jin@emory.edu) and I am happy to discuss more! -->

<!-- **I am actively looking for post-doc opportunities. Please feel free to contact me if you have one!** -->


I am a research scientist at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division.html) with hands-on experience in designing and implementing statistical and machine learning methods to solve real-world problems. My background includes rigorous training in data analysis, statistical modeling, and causal inference, with a strong emphasis on generating actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional data.

I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at [Emory University](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html). where I worked on developing robust and efficient statistical procedures using machine learning techniques. My work has involved high-dimensional feature selection, targeted learning algorithms, and theory for two-stage sampling designs - techniques that I have applied to large-scale datasets to support data-driven decision-making.

I enjoy working at the intersection of statistics and data science, and I am passionate about developing reliable, interpretable, and scalable solutions that drive real-world impact.
